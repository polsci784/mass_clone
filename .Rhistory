Description:  In Mexico (V2=484) there is a left skew for the population distribution. The diagram demonstrates there is a greater younger population (16-30) in comparison to the USA (V2=840). In the USA, there is a right skew that indicates a greater population of elderly individuals aged 46-60 and over 60 years of age. In sum, in Mecio, there is a younger population while in the USA, there is an older population.
